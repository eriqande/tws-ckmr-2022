Conn and Eric C. Anderson 2022-05-23 Preface This is the website/book associated with the Close-kin mark-recapture: theory and practice workshop to be held at The Wildlife Society meetings Nov 6, 2022 in Spokane, Washington. 0.1 Setting up your computer This course covers topics in close-kin mark recapture, and relies heavily on the R programming language. In order to follow along with the code and be successful in running all of the examples, it will be helpful (if not imperative) to have recent versions of R and RStudio, and updated versions of a number of packages. The following is a description of the software needed to engage in the course. This setup was tested on a Mac with an Intel chip running BigSur OSX 11, but should also work on most other Mac or Windows operating systems. 0.1.1 Step 2. Install a number of R packages that are relatively easy to install Our work will require a number of packages that can be found in binary form on CRAN. As such, installing them is typically not to arduous. This year, we are exploring use of the ‘renv’ package to help with installing necessary packages. 0.1.2 Step 3. Make sure you have git and an account on GitHub In a two-day workshop, we don’t have time to go deeply, if much at all, into the many uses of the version control software, git, and the cloud-based code management system GitHub, that is built upon git. But, if you are interested in version control for your analyses, and you are interested in using GitHub to share and present the results of your research, then you really will want to become proficient with both git and GitHub. Fortunately, there is an outstanding, free book on the web that goes into great detail about how to use git and GitHub with R and RStudio. It is available at https://happygitwithr.com/, and it is well worth a read, and particularly following the steps in: Chapter 4. Register a GitHub account. Chapter 6. Install Git (Note: Mac users , if xcode-select --install ran successfully, then git will have been installed). Chapter 7. Introduce yourself to git If you want to use GitHub, you will also have to establish an SSH public/private key pair to authenticate your computer to GitHub. That is described in: Chapter 10: Set up keys for SSH "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
