# Preface {-}

This is the website/book associated with the _Close-kin mark-recapture: theory and practice_ workshop to be held at The Wildlife Society meetings Nov 6, 2022 in Spokane, Washington.

## Workshop schedule

An approximate schedule for the workshop is as follows:

8:00 - 8:45   Close-kin mark-recapture: An overview (P. Conn)  
8:45 - 9:30   An introduction to genetic data and inheritance   (E. Anderson)  
9:30 - 9:45  Break  
9:45 - 10:30  Statistical inference for CKMR estimation (P. Conn)  
10:30 - 11:15  Kin finding (E. Anderson)  
11:15 - 12:00  Designing a CKMR experiment (P. Conn)  
12:00 - 1:00 Lunch  
1:00 - 5:00 R/TMB labs (full day participants only)  


Workshop attendees had the option of registering for half-day or full-day sessions.  The first half will consist almost entirely of lectures, with no previous programming experience needed. The second half will involve labs and exercises conducted in R and/or Template Model Builder (at the user's discretion).  Full day participants should use the following set of instructions to set up their computers prior to the workshop.

## Setting up your computer {#setting-computer}

This course covers topics in close-kin mark recapture, and the second half of the course relies
heavily on the R programming language.  In order to follow
along with the code and be successful in running all of the
examples, it will be helpful (if not imperative) for full-day workshop participants to have recent versions of
R and RStudio, and updated versions of a number of packages.  

The following is a description of the software needed to engage in the
course.  This setup was tested on a Mac with an Intel chip running BigSur OSX 11, as well as on a PC running Windows 10.  We suspect it will 
also work on most other Mac or Windows operating systems.


### Step 2. Install a number of R packages that are relatively easy to install

Our work will require a number of packages that can be found in binary
form on CRAN.  As such, installing them is typically not too arduous.

This year, we are exploring use of the 'renv' package to help with installing
necessary packages.

In the full day workshop we will make some use of Template Model Builder (TMB); attendees might
wish to familiarize themselves with how it works (e.g., https://kaskr.github.io/adcomp/Introduction.html).

### Step 3.  Make sure you have git and an account on GitHub

In a two-day workshop, we don't have time to go deeply, if much at all, into
the many uses of the version control software, `git`, and the cloud-based code management
system GitHub, that is built upon git.  But, if you are interested in version control for
your analyses, and you are interested in using GitHub to share and present the results
of your research, then you really will want to become proficient with both `git` and
GitHub.

Fortunately, there is an outstanding, free book on the web that goes into
great detail about how to use git and GitHub with R and RStudio.  It is available
at [https://happygitwithr.com/](https://happygitwithr.com/), and it is well worth
a read, and particularly following the steps in:

- **Chapter 4. Register a GitHub account**.
- **Chapter 6. Install Git**  (Note: Mac users , if `xcode-select --install`
    ran successfully, then git will have been installed).
- **Chapter 7. Introduce yourself to git**

If you want to use GitHub, you will also have to establish an SSH public/private
key pair to authenticate your computer to GitHub. That is described in:

- **Chapter 10: Set up keys for SSH**
