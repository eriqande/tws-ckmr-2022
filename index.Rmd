## Setting up your computer {#setting-computer}

This course covers topics in close-kin mark recapture, and relies
heavily on the R programming language.  In order to follow
along with the code and be successful in running all of the
examples, it will be helpful (if not imperative) to have recent versions of
R and RStudio, and updated versions of a number of packages.  

The following is a description of the software needed to engage in the
course.  This setup was tested on a Mac with an Intel chip running BigSur OSX 11, but
should also work on most other Mac or Windows operating systems.


### Step 2. Install a number of R packages that are relatively easy to install

Our work will require a number of packages that can be found in binary
form on CRAN.  As such, installing them is typically not to arduous.

This year, we are exploring use of the 'renv' package to help with installing
necessary packages.

### Step 3.  Make sure you have git and an account on GitHub

In a two-day workshop, we don't have time to go deeply, if much at all, into
the many uses of the version control software, `git`, and the cloud-based code management
system GitHub, that is built upon git.  But, if you are interested in version control for
your analyses, and you are interested in using GitHub to share and present the results
of your research, then you really will want to become proficient with both `git` and
GitHub.

Fortunately, there is an outstanding, free book on the web that goes into
great detail about how to use git and GitHub with R and RStudio.  It is available
at [https://happygitwithr.com/](https://happygitwithr.com/), and it is well worth
a read, and particularly following the steps in:

- **Chapter 4. Register a GitHub account**.
- **Chapter 6. Install Git**  (Note: Mac users , if `xcode-select --install`
    ran successfully, then git will have been installed).
- **Chapter 7. Introduce yourself to git**

If you want to use GitHub, you will also have to establish an SSH public/private
key pair to authenticate your computer to GitHub. That is described in:

- **Chapter 10: Set up keys for SSH**
