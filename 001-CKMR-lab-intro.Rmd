# CKMR thought experiments and labs

In the second half of this course, we're going to switch gears and delve into some code.  But first,
we're going to conduct a few thought experiments to try to get you to think critically about
some of the CKMR concepts we've covered so far.  We'll also be switching from slides to this "book" -
hopefully this will be a useful resource for those of you who want to look back at course content.

## Thought experiments

We think it would be useful for participants to break into small groups for this one.  So let's do that!
