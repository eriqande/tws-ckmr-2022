## Preliminaries: What we want you to get out of this workshop {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

* The basic idea of how CKMR works

* Types of CKMR models and their assumptions

* Strengths and limitations of CKMR for wildlife monitoring and management

* Basic ideas on how to design a CKMR study

* For full day participants, some ideas of how to code things up

We don't expect anyone to be a CKMR expert after taking this workshop.  There are a lot of levels of 
expertise required for successful CKMR implentations (including ecology, genetics, and statistics) - there are only a few people on earth that are an expert in all of these!!!

## CKMR in a nutshell {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

A framework for estimating *adult* abundance and survival using the frequency of
observed kinship relationships 

Parent-offspring pairs (POPs) \rightarrow Adult abundance and reproductive schedules (assuming age is known...)

Half-sibling pairs (HSPs) \rightarrow Adult abundance and survival (again assuming ages are known)

## Pseudo-likelihood {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}


Compare each genotyped sample to all of the others.  We can then maximize the 
pseudo-likelihood

$\prod_i \prod_{j>i} p_{ij}^{y_{ij}} (1-p_{ij})^{1-y_{ij}}$

$y_{ij}$ is a binary random variable taking on the value 1.0 if animals
$i$ and $j$ are a match.  

$p_{ij}$ is the probability of a match

![](paul1-images/Are_you_my_mother.jpg)

## Pseudo-likelihood {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}


Compare each genotyped sample to all of the others.  We can then maximize the 
pseudo-likelihood

$\prod_i \prod_{j>i} p_{ij} y_{ij} + (1-p_{ij}) (1-y_{ij})$

$y_{ij}$ is a binary random variable taking on the value 1.0 if animals
$i$ and $j$ are a match.  

$p_{ij}$ is the probability of a match

## Expected relative reproductive output {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

But how do we figure out what the $p_{ij}$ probabilities are?  And how are these related to what we care about (abundance and survival)?

-Depends on what type of relationship is being considered, sex of parent, etc.

-Calculations rely on ERRO

## Expected relative reproductive output {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

### Simple example: mother-offspring pairs, knife-edged sexual maturity, no heterogeneity in reproductive success, $b_i < b_j$

\begin{equation*} p_{ij} = \begin{cases}
      0, & \text{if}\ a_i(b_j) < a_{mat} \text{ or } d_i < b_j \\
      1/N_{b_j}^F, & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*}

In words: the probability of a mother-offspring pair is zero if the potential mother was reproductively immature or dead at the time of $j$'s birth.  If the potential mother *was* reproductively mature, it is simply 1 over the number of reproductively mature females.

## CKMR Assumptions {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

 1. Accurate genotyping (no false positives!)
 
 2. Population and sampling models are accurate 

 3. Kinship comparisons are "independent" (or close enough...)
 
 4. No undiagnosed relationship between kinship probabilities and sampling probabilities that can't be explained by observed (or inferred) covariates
    
    * Age
    
    * Spatial location
    
    * Status (Mating hierarchy)


## CKMR Assumptions - Implications {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}
    
 1. Accurate genotyping (no false positives!)
 
 We need enough genetic markers to tell apart various kin groups.  For parent-offspring pairs we 
 might only need 200 SNPs or so, but for half-siblings it is nice to have 3-4K (after pruning ill-behaved loci).

$\color{red}{\rightarrow \text{High quality tissue samples}}$


## CKMR Assumptions - Implications {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}
    
 2. Population model and sampling models are accurate
 
* For species where reproductive maturity is not instantaneous, we need to model pre-adult population dynamics, so
we need some idea of early survival and reproductive schedules (decent early life history information!).  We also need to
get the underlying Leslie matrix right (pre vs. postbreeding census, etc.)

* Accurate sampling models have more to do with independent fates.  E.g. we won't want to model mothers and dependent offspring harvested
in the same year, half-siblings harvested together, etc.

:::{.callout-important}
## Do sampling events over-represent the frequency of kin pairs in the population?
CKMR estimates likely to be biased!!!  One strategy is to omit certain categories of comparison (e.g., only making cross-cohort HSP comparisons, do not make mother-offspring
comparisons for females and young harvested at the same time)
:::



## CKMR Assumptions - Implications {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

 3. Kinship comparisons are "independent" (or close enough...)
 

The quality of the pseudo-likelihood as an approximation decreases as the amount of relatedness in a population
increases.  The usual effect when this happens in statistics is that precision (e.g., confidence intervals) is
overstated.  

CKMR has been conducted on populations as low as $\approx 600$ but we don't want to go super low.

:::{.callout-important}
## Is there a relationship between kinship and sampling probabilities ?
CKMR estimates likely to be biased!!!  If covariates are available to explain this relationship, they should be modeled to fix the problem.  In some cases, e.g., highly fecund individuals having a greater propensity to be harvested, we might need to adjust our estimation strategy (e.g., leave out father-offspring comparisons for deer) or model them differently somehow.

## So what populations is CKMR good for? {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}



:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

* Populations that are "not too big and not too small" (e.g. several hundred to ten million or so)
Need $\approx 50$ kin pairs to produce reasonable estimates, required # of samples increases with $\sqrt{N}$

* Decent genetic variation (severe inbreeding may make it difficult to discriminate different kin pair types)

* Good "mixing" (either through movement or through sampling)  

* ~~Group living species~~

* One mother and one father!  No weird breeding systems (e.g., armadillos)

* Ages are extremely helpful (teeth? epigenetics? sampling young?)

* Some will require case-specific developments (philopatry, spatial structure, pair bonding)

### Completed or underway as of 2022 (c/o M. Bravington)

![](paul1-images/map-ck-2022.jpg)


## How easy is it to conduct CKMR experiments? {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

* Skill level probably depends on what type of data (e.g., POP-only, POP+HSP, single cohort vs. multiple cohort)

* Relatively low cost, especially after markers and aging methods are developed (epigenetics?)

* You're going to want to have a biologist, biometrician, and a geneticist involved.  Very few people have all skills and it's a lot to
ask of a single person (especially a grad student!!!)

* Many models will need to be population- and data-dependent and will require bespoken code.  That said, there are examples and templates out there that will help.

species; see beluga example [here](https://closekin.github.io/beluga_design.html))

* Implications for monitoring/management

* There are sometimes ways to help improve precision in the present by designing a CKMR experiment correctly!

## A CKMR case study: Bearded seals {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

Our paper isn't published yet so I can't make all data public yet. But we can still use life history information, approximate sample sizes, and kin finding data to help motivate ideas and conduct some modeling exercises.

* Size of Beringia DPS thought to be 400-500K seals!  

* We had something like 2000 tissue samples over $\approx 20$ 
years.

* Can we use this to get an idea of overall abundance?  What special things will we need to 
consider when fitting models to these data?
