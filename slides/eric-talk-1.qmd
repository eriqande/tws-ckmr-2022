- Gregor Mendel (1822-1884)
- Inferred laws of genetic segregation 
by observing patterns of single-locus traits
in pea plants.
- Not applicable to most (polygenic) traits
- But, we now know his laws are quite applicable
to the transmission of genetic material
in _diploid_ organisms.
- They apply to dicussing the inheritance of a
_locus_.

## What the heck is a locus? {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

- The word "locus" in genetics, much like the word "gene" has been applied to a lot
of things.

- For our purposes, we will use it to refer to a "chunk" of DNA that is defined
by its position in the genome.

- For example, around base position X on Chromosome 3:

- Two copies of the DNA at each locus.  One chromosome from mom. Another from dad.

## Mendels Law of Segregation {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

When gametes are formed, the two copies of each locus _segregate_ so that each
gamete carries exactly one copy of each locus.

Since individuals are formed by the union of gametes, this dictates the segregation
of DNA to offspring.
