## Outline {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

1. Motivation
1. Mendelian Inheritance
2. Identity-by-descent
3. Physical linkage
4. Genetic markers and identity in state
6. Pairwise joint genotype probabilities
5. Types of genetic markers


## Motivation {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

- Close-kin mark-recapture depends on identifying pairs of related individuals
- Genetic data are used to identify these relatives
- Relatives can be identified because they "share" more of their genome than
unrelated (or less related) individuals.
- A rigorous definition of what is meant by "genome sharing" is required.

## Starting from the beginning {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%" .incremental}
- Gregor Mendel (1822-1884)
- Inferred laws of genetic segregation 
by observing patterns of single-locus traits
in pea plants.
- Not applicable to most (polygenic) traits
- But, we now know his laws are quite applicable
to the transmission of genetic material
in _diploid_ organisms.
- They apply to dicussing the inheritance of a
_locus_.

## What the heck is a locus? {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

- The word "locus" in genetics, much like the word "gene" has been applied to a lot
of things.

- For our purposes, we will use it to refer to a "chunk" of DNA that is defined
by its position in the genome.

- For example, around base position X on Chromosome 3:

![](eric-images/karyotypes.jpg)

- Two copies of the DNA at each locus.  One chromosome from mom. Another from dad.

## Mendel's First Law of Segregation (in sexual _diploids_){background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

When gametes are formed, the two copies of each locus _segregate_ so that each
gamete carries exactly one copy of each locus.

Since individuals are formed by the union of gametes, this dictates the segregation
of DNA to offspring:

- Each child receives exactly one copy of a locus from its mother and one from its father.
- The copy of the locus received from the parent is chosen randomly (with probability $\frac{1}{2}$ for each) from amongst the two copies in the parent.

::: {.column width="40%"}
Consider the case of the maternal allele segregated
to an offspring, in the pedigree to the right.

- Circles are females.
- Males are squares.

## Mendel's Second Law {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

"The gene copy that gets segregated to a gamete/offspring at one locus is
independent of the gene copy that gets segregated at another locus."

- This is not universally true.
- It is only true for loci that are on different chromosomes.

When two loci are on the same chromosome they are referred to as
"physically linked" 

AND, they do _not_ segregate independently. 


## Chromosomes, Crossovers, and Recombination {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
- Chromosomes are inherited in big chunks
- Crossovers occur between the maternal and paternal chromosomes
of an individual.
- An odd number of crossovers between two loci = recombination
- Crossover modeled as a Poisson process along chromosomes.
- Loci close together are less likely to have a recombination

- We will come back to linked loci later today.  
- For now, we focus on a single locus...


## Genetic Identity by Descent {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

- When the DNA at a locus is a direct copy of the DNA in an ancestor...
- Or when the stretches of DNA in two different individuals at a locus are _both_ copies of the same piece of DNA in a recent ancestor...
- These pieces of DNA are termed **identical by descent**, (IBD).

## The number of gene copies IBD{background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}


- A pair of _non-inbred_ diploid individuals can share 0, 1, or 2 gene copies
IBD at a locus.

- Each possible relationship between two non-inbred individuals can be characterized
by the expected fraction of the genome at which the two individuals share 0, 1, or 2
gene copies IBD.
$$
\bkappa = (\kappa_0, \kappa_1, \kappa_2)
$$
    - $\kappa_0$: expected fraction of genome with 0 gene copies IBD
    - $\kappa_1$: expected fraction of genome with 1 gene copy IBD
    - $\kappa_2$: expected fraction of genome with 2 gene copies IBD
- These are also the _marginal_ probabilities that a pair of individuals share
0, 1, or 2, gene copies at a single locus.
- Sometimes called "Cotterman coefficients", we will call them "kappas"

- These are not the coefficient of relationship or coefficient of consanguinity. (Those are
not sufficient).


## $\bkappa$ for Parent-Offspring Pairs {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

::: {.incremental}
- We start with an easy one
- What is $\bkappa$ for the parent offspring relationship?
- Well, a parent and offspring always share exactly one gene copy IBD.
- 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\kappa_0 &= 0 \\
\kappa_1 &= 1 \\
\kappa_2 &= 0 \\
\end{aligned}
$$
- or
$$
\bkappa = (0, 1, 0)
$$

## $\bkappa$ for Half-Sibling Pairs {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

::: {.incremental fig-align="center"}

- A slightly harder one: ![](../figure-creation/eric/hs-plain.svg){width="33%" fig-align="center"} 
- We know that, with probability 1, Pa segregates a copy of a single gene to Kid-1
- With probability $\frac{1}{2}$ Pa segregates of a copy of the same gene to Kid-2
- With probability $\frac{1}{2}$ Pa segregates a copy of the other gene to Kid-2
-
$$
\begin{aligned}
\kappa_0 &= 1/2\\
\kappa_1 &= 1/2 \\
\kappa_2 &= 0 \\
\end{aligned}
$$

:::




## $\bkappa$ for Full-Sibling Pairs {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

::: {.incremental fig-align="center"}

- Like two independent half-sib relationships... ![](../figure-creation/eric/full-sib-plain.svg){width="20%" fig-align="center"} 
- With probability $\frac{1}{2}$, Kid-1 and Kid-2 share 1 gene copy (or 0 gene copies) IBD from Ma
- _Independently_, with probability $\frac{1}{2}$, Kid-1 and Kid-2 share 1 gene copy (or 0 gene copies) IBD from Pa.
- So, no gene copies IBD = none from Ma and none from Pa = $\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}$.
- Two gene copies IBD = one from Ma and one from Pa = $\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}$
- One gene copy IBD = one from Ma and zero from Pa, or zero from Ma and one from Pa = 
$\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}$.
- So, $\kappa_0 = \frac{1}{4}~~~~~~\kappa_1 = \frac{1}{2}~~~~~~\kappa_1 = \frac{1}{4}$
