## ERRO revisited {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}


Expected Relative Reproductive Output (ERRO) 

Ratio of expected reproductive output (# offspring) of a potential parent to the total
expected reproductive output of the population in the year of a potential offspring's birth.



\begin{equation*}
  ERRO_i(y) =  \frac{R_i(y)}{R_+(y)} 
\end{equation*}

where:

* $R_i(y)$ is the expected reproductive output of individaul $i$ in year $y$

* $R_+(y)$ is the total reproductive output of the population in year $y$


## ERRO revisited {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}


In terms of practical parameters (and functions of parameters), calculation of ERRO depends on: 

(1) age-specific abundances in the year of interest, 
(2) expected reproductive output of age $a$ animals

Assuming a 50/50 sex ratio, and that we're interested in computing ERRO for 
mother $i$ in the year of $j$'s birth (relative to females only) is:

\begin{equation*}
  ERRO_i (b_j) =  \frac{R_i(b_j)}{R_+(b_j)} =  \frac{I_{ij} f_{a_i(b_j)}}{\sum_a 0.5 N_{b_j,a} f_a}
\end{equation*}

where:

* $f_a$ is fecundity of age $a$ females (i.e. expected number of offspring)

* $N_{t,a}$ is the abundance of age $a$ individuals at time $t$

* $a_i(b_j)$ is the age of individual $i$ in the year of $j$'s birth.

* $I_{ij}$ is an indicator taking on 1.0 if individual $i$ was alive in year $b_j$ and
is zero otherwise


## POP probabilities {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

In the case where we know ages perfectly, the probability of a mother-offspring 
pair (MOP) is exactly ERRO!!

\begin{equation*}
  p_{ij} | b_i, b_j, d_i = ERRO_i(b_j) =  \frac{I_{ij} f_{a_i(b_j)}}{\sum_a 0.5 N_{b_j,a} f_a}
\end{equation*}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

* We will often make different calculations for MOPs and FOPs (father-offspring pairs) owing to different fecundity schedules (and perhaps survival schedules).

* When ages are uncertain, ERRO $\ne$ $p_{ij}$ because we must integrate over possible
ages of animals (stay tuned...)

## HSP probabilities {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

Half-sibling pairs are trickier, but still make use of ERRO!!  Since we don't 
observe the parent ($h$), or know when it dies, we must sum over probabilities for each possible parent alive at time $b_i$


\begin{eqnarray*}
  p_{ij} | b_i, b_j & = & \sum_{h}  \frac{R_h(b_i)}{R_+(b_i)} \frac{R_h(b_j)}{R_+(b_j)}
\end{eqnarray*}

* We'll again often break thinks down by maternal- and/or paternal HSPs (MHSPs, PHSPs)


## HSP probabilities {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

Assuming a 50/50 sex ratio, and $b_i<b_j$, a maternal HSP (MHSP) probability *could* be

\begin{eqnarray*}
  p_{ij} | b_i, b_j & = & \sum_{h \in \mathcal{F}_{b_i}}  \frac{f_{a_h(b_i)}}{\sum_a 0.5 N_{b_i,a} f_a} \times 
                          \phi_h({b_i \rightarrow b_j}) \times \frac{ f_{a_h(b_j)}}{\sum_a 0.5                                N_{b_j,a} f_a}  
\end{eqnarray*}

* $\mathcal{F}_{b_i}$ the set of all females alive at $b_i$

* $\phi_h({b_i \rightarrow b_j})$ is the probability that potential mother $h$ survives from
  the time of $i$'s birth to the time of $j$'s birth

## HSP probabilities {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

Assuming a 50/50 sex ratio, a maternal HSP (MHSP) probability *could* be

\begin{eqnarray*}
  p_{ij} | b_i, b_j & = & \sum_{h}  \frac{f_{a_h(b_i)}}{\sum_a 0.5 N_{b_i,a} f_a} \times 
                          \phi_h({b_i \rightarrow b_j}) \times \frac{ f_{a_h(b_j)}}{\sum_a 0.5                                N_{b_j,a} f_a}  \\
                    & = & \sum_a \frac{0.5 N_{b_i,a} f_a}{\sum_{a^\prime} 0.5 
                          N_{b_i,a^\prime} f_{a^\prime}} 
                          \left( \prod_{t=b_i}^{b_j-1} S_{ta} \right)
                          \frac{ f_{a+\delta_{ij}}}{\sum_{a^\prime} 0.5 
                          N_{b_j,a^\prime} f_{a^\prime}}   \\
                    & = & \sum_a \frac{N_{b_i,a} f_a}{\sum_{a^\prime}  
                          N_{b_i,a^\prime} f_{a^\prime}} 
                          \left( \prod_{t=b_i}^{b_j-1} S_{ta} \right)
                          \frac{ f_{a+\delta_{ij}}}{\sum_{a^\prime} 
                          0.5 N_{b_j,a^\prime} f_{a^\prime}}
\end{eqnarray*}


* $S_{ta}$ is annual survival for age $a$ animals in year $t$
* $\delta_{ij} = b_j - b_i$



## Types of models: age-structured vs. adult-only {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

So far, we've written probabilities in terms of

* Age-specific fecundity (this will also likely be sex-specific!)
* Age- and time-specific abundance
* Age (and maybe time- or sex-specific) survival

## Addressing assumption violations through comparison restrictions {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

We'll often want to remove comparisons (and, yes kin matches too!) for encounters that 
are likely to violate CKMR assumptions:

* Dependence of fates between mothers and possibly dependent young 
  + Do not make comparisons involving animals harvested the year they were born
  + Do not make comparisons with adult females and others that were born in the year of 
    the adult females harvest
    
* Limit half-sibling comparisons to cross cohort comparisons [if ages are reliable]

* Perhaps just ignore adult males as parents (okay to look for their mothers) if
  major dominance 
  
* Perhaps ignore half-sibling comparisons entirely if there tend to be a lot of full siblings

### Aging error

So far, we've assumed aging error is known with certainty.  Often it is anything but!!

In order to model it, we really need to have an aging error model.  i.e., given true age $a$, what is the probability of aging an animal as age $\tilde{a}$?  Call this distribution $[\tilde{a}|a]$.

```{r aging_error,echo=FALSE}
  Age = c(0:10)
  Probability = rep(0,11)
  mu = 5
  sd = 1
  Probability = dnorm(Age,mu,sd)
  Probability = Probability/sum(Probability)
  plot(Age,Probability,type="l",xlab='Assigned age')
  abline(v=5,col="blue")
```

## Addressing assumption violations through modeling {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

### Aging error

How to get the aging error distribution, $[\tilde{a}|a]$?

* Gold standard (subset of animals with known ages) - allows you to estimate bias in 
aging method (Conn & Diefenbach 2007)

* Multiple age readings from a subset of animals - allows you to estimate precision of the aging criterion but need to assume age readings are unbiased (Fisheries papers like Richards et al. 1992)

Summaries from aging labs from individual teeth will not typically be sufficient to get a handle on aging error!

![](paul2-images/cementum.png){width=30%}

## Addressing assumption violations through modeling {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

### Aging error

According to Bayes rule, 

\begin{equation*}
  [a_i | \tilde{a}_i] \propto [\tilde{a}_i | a_i] [a_i]
\end{equation*}

That is, the probability that an animal is truly aged $a_i$, given that it was assigned
age $\tilde{a}_i$ is a product of the aging error model and a prior distribution on age!

Example:

| $\pi_a$ |  $s_a$ | $\pi_a s_a$ | $Pr(a_i)$ |
| -----|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| 0.5      |  0.0  | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| 0.3      |  1.0  | 0.3 | 0.6 |
| 0.2      |  1.0  | 0.2 | 0.4 |

* $\pi_a$ is the *expected* proportion of age $a$ animals in the population (e.g.,
from stable age calculations)

* $s_a$ is the selectivity / relative detection probability of age $a$ animals

* $\rightarrow$  We'll likely need to know, assume, or set a prior for $s_a$!!

### Aging error

Assuming we have data to estimate aging error distributions and a prior distribution of
ages, we can implement a CKMR model that sums across the possibility of different age combinations

### Cross cohort HSPs

We'll still want to eliminate these where possible (e.g., don't compare young-of-year harvested in same year), but when we have aging error, assigning cohorts is imperfect!

* We can use knowledge of the mating system to describe the probability of getting an HSP born in the same year

* We'll need to account for the distribution of litter sizes, expected proportion of half-siblings / full-siblings in same litter

* The probability of HSPs born in the same year will usually be low for most harvested mammals!

### Imperfect HSP determinations

If HSP analysis is even possible (it might not be if there is a high frequency of full sibs), it is still often difficult to fully discriminate half-siblings from lower order kin (half-nibling, etc.).  False positives really foul things up, so need to account for this somehow.

### Parental sex uncertainty (HSPs)

* In many cases, male and female may have different reproductive and mortality schedules so need to be treated differently

* For HSPs, mtDNA can be used to infer parental sex if mt-haplotype diversity is high

* If there are a limited number of haplotypes, sharing mtDNA is not a definitive sex determination...we're back in mixture model land!

* Use frequency of each haplotype ($\tau_x$) to determine probabilities of sex (Bayes rule again!)

### Heterogeneity in reproductive success


In CKMR analysis, all we have to go on is observed covariates (which hopefully includes
age or a proxy).  If there is considerable heterogeneity in reproductive success that can't be explained by covariates, the number of *effective* adults may be $<<$ than the census number of adults.

In mammals, this is more likely to be an issue with males (dominance)

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

Approaches: 

* Leave paternal comparisons out

* Leave them in and model the number of effective male breeders as $\tilde{N}^M_t = \kappa N^M_t$, where $0 \le \kappa \le 1$.  

* Males unlikely to provide much demographic information, but $\kappa$ might be of interest in its own right!

## Recall the general form for CKMR pseudo-likelihood 

$\prod_i \prod_{j>i} p_{ij}^{y_{ij}} (1-p_{ij})^{1-y_{ij}}$
:::

However, if we conduct inference for each individual separately with this naive
pseudo-likelihood we have $\binom{n}{2}$ comparisons!

| n | # comparisons |
|---------|:-----|
| 500      | 124,750   | 
| 1000     | 499,500  | 
| 2000     | 1,999,000  | 
| 10000    | 49,950,000 |

$\rightarrow$ Maybe not too bad with small sample sizes, but extremely problematic for large ones
particularly when likelihood calculations are costly.

In particular, we'll summarize (# of comparisons, # of successes) as a function
of relevant covariates to our analysis.  These often include things like

* birth year of older animal ($b_1$)
* birth year of younger animal ($b_2$)
* death year of older animal ($y_1$)
* sex of older animal ($s_1$)
* location of harvest

Example: 

POPs:

$L_{pop} \propto \prod_{b_1} \prod_{b_2} \prod_{y_1} \prod_s p_{b_1,b_2,y_1,s}^{m_{b_1,b_2,y_1,s}} (1-p_{b_1,b_2,y_1,s})^{n_{b_1,b_2,y_1,s}-m_{b_1,b_2,y_1,s}}$

where

* $n_{blah, blah}$ is the number of comparisons with blah, blah covariates
* $m_{blah, blah}$ is the number of kin matches with blah, blah covariates

Let's say we're looking at a 20 year study where the max age of an animal is 20 years old. Then we'll probably want to run a CKMR model for 40 years.  We thus have to potentially perform 40 years $\times$ 40 years $\times$ 20 years $\times$ 2 sexes = 64,000 calculations per likelihood evaluation.  However, in practice, this can often be improved on by eliminating impossible combinations (e.g., $b_1 \ge b_2$, $y_1 < b_2$, $n_{blah,bah}=0$, etc.)

## Pseudo-likelihood and optimization {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

In general in statistics, we optimize the likelihood by minimizing the negative log-likelihood as a function of parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$.  This is the approach we'll take here, sometimes putting priors on parameters (so minimizing a negative log-posterior).

$L_{pop}|\boldsymbol{\theta} \propto \prod_{b_1} \prod_{b_2} \prod_{y_1} \prod_s p_{b_1,b_2,y_1,s}^{m_{b_1,b_2,y_1,s}} (1-p_{b_1,b_2,y_1,s})^{n_{b_1,b_2,y_1,s}-m_{b_1,b_2,y_1,s}}$

$NLL_{pop}|\boldsymbol{\theta} \propto \sum_{b_1} \sum_{b_2} \sum_{y_1} \sum_s m_{b_1,b_2,y_1,s} \log(p_{b_1,b_2,y_1,s}) +  (n_{b_1,b_2,y_1,s}-m_{b_1,b_2,y_1,s}) \log (1-p_{b_1,b_2,y_1,s})$

* For "simple" models, log-likelihoods can be written and minimized in R

* For "complicated" models, we'll often want some type of auto-differentiation procedure
to minimize the negative log-likelihood (e.g. TMB + nlminb)

* Values for $p_{b_1,b_2,y_1,s}$ can get very small.  We'll want to prevent numerical underflow by doing something like $\log(p+(p==0))$

* May also want to consider a Poisson approx. to the binomial

* For models with POPs *and* HSPs, minimize $NLL_{pop}+NLL_{hsp}$!

## Pseudo-likelihood and optimization {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

* For POP-only models, $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ can include adult abundance and fecundity-at-age schedules (there is typically much less info about the latter; probably worth specifying a prior)

* For HSP-only models, $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ can include adult abundance and adult survival 

* These parameters enter into the likelihood through $p_{blah,blah}$

## Bearded seal example {background-image="quarto-static/slideswoosh-white.png" background-size="contain"}

* POPs + GGHSP

* Out of $\approx 1500$ samples, 2 POPs, 8 maternal GGHSPs, 17 paternal GGHSPs 

* Age structured CKMR model

* Assume fixed fecundity-at-age (females), maturity-at-age (males) schedules; prior distribution on mortality

* Penalty if $\lambda$ differs from target value (typically 1.0) 

* Tried one model with reduced adult male abundance reflecting heterogeneity in male repro success

* Tried several thresholds for HSP PLOD scores

Updated survival priors: lower maximum survival, but reduced senescent effect

### Some thoughts...

* Uncertainty almost certainly underestimated

* Estimates are mostly lower than those expected from comprehensive aerial surveys (400-500K)

* What population are we estimating??
